The  provisions of this section 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement,  howsoever caused, but this shall not imply or create any continued right to Use  the Software after termination of this Agreement.

Adobe is  acting on behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding  and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this  Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose. For further  information, please contact Adobe's Customer Support Department. Some states do  not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or special  damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.</p>

None  of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any  act or acquiescence on the part of Adobe, its agents, or employees, but only by  an instrument in writing signed by an authorized signatory of Adobe. It is  expressly agreed that a breach of Sections 3 or 4 of this Agreement may cause  irreparable harm to Adobe and that a remedy at law may be inadequate,  therefore, in addition to any and all remedies available at law, Adobe will be  entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable remedies in all legal  proceedings in the event of any threatened or actual violation thereof. When  conflicting language exists between this License Agreement and any other  agreement included in this Package, this Agreement shall supersede.

You acknowledge that You have read this Agreement,  understand it, and that it is the complete and exclusive statement of Your  agreement with Adobe which supersedes any prior agreement, oral or written,  between Adobe and You with respect to the licensing to You of this Package. No  variation of the terms of this Agreement will be enforceable against Adobe  unless Adobe gives its express consent, in writing, signed by an authorized  signatory of Adobe.</p>
